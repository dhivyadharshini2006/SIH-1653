## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

Ministry of Defence

## Idea
Develop an AI-driven interview assessment system that ensures a structured, unbiased, and efficient recruitment process. 

The system will:

1.Simulate a real-life boardroom interview experience.

2.Dynamically generate and evaluate relevant techno-managerial questions.

3.Provide a quantifiable and objective scoring mechanism for both experts and candidates.

4.Assist in evaluating candidate suitability for advertised posts based on expertise and response relevance.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The AI-Based Interview Assessment System for RAC (DRDO) is designed to enhance the efficiency and objectivity of the recruitment and promotion process. The system simulates a real-life boardroom interview, ensuring a structured and unbiased assessment. It consists of an AI-driven virtual panel that begins with ice-breaking questions before transitioning to in-depth techno-managerial discussions. The AI dynamically selects and adjusts questions based on the candidate’s expertise, ensuring relevance and depth. It also evaluates candidate responses using NLP-based semantic analysis, grading them based on accuracy, depth, and coherence. The system further calculates a relevance score for both experts’ questions and candidates’ responses, generating a final suitability score. A detailed report is then provided to assist in final decision-making. The platform integrates with speech processing, video conferencing, and cloud-based analytics, ensuring scalability and compliance with government security standards. This system ensures bias-free, data-driven, and efficient hiring and promotion decisions for DRDO.
